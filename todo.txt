            Call class methods in the "/Update"

        2   Make front end into class
            All planes/airports/centers are objects, all children of parent that holds latest_json, etc.

        3   Improve Performance
            Searching through latest_json array      should not be necessary for drawing airport/airplane lines (on hover)
