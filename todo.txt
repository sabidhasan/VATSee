         Critical Features to Add / Bugfixes:
              Size/color of circles
              Centre polygon
              Heading for planes (pngs)
              If no departure/arrival airport, then dont draw lines on hover!
              Dela with aircraft that have no departure/arrival (should have no departure/arrival ID and not draw a line upon hover)
              Add logging
                              log airports at 0,0 lat/lon. These should be entered into database
                              log all non-parsable lines from reading vatsim txt file
              Randomize VATSIM server access
              JavaScript should add autoupdate every minute, as should Python
              REQUEST METAR method (on clicking an airport, it returns a JSON of the METAR)
              Show arrivals and departures sorted by time - currently unsorted (simple fix I think)!

              Tab: Clicked on plane (airports currently work)
              Tab: Online (list of all online users / ATC)
              Tab: Flight Planning
              Tab: Weather
              Tab: Events
              Tab: Preferences
              DB Cleanup: if someone in DB but not ONLINE, then DELETE

          Non Critical relatively Easy:
                Which country airspace for hovered airplanes

                Using which simulator for info window

                Add hover for info window - time online, pilot; ALSO correct typos in that hover window
               If ZOOM is > x, then show ALL airports

          Nice to Have Features (hard):
               ICAO/VATSIM/PE connection
               Make the backend into a Class, and call class methods in the "/Update" function, rahter than doing thigns there

               get_history route, wihch returns history of given plane

               Add hover for info window - time online, frequency, controller name, METAR, airport diagram/procedures etc.

                DELAY
                        Also, show busiest airports (based on # of departuesx and arrivals)
                        if not in DB and 0 AGL, then INJECT them into DB
                        if ARE in DB and 0 AGL, do nothing
                        if > 0 AGL but <5000 ft and IN DB, then calculate delay (started at 0, but now taken off), DELETE from DB
                Reduce bandwidth
                         Plane heading roatation should be done in front end to reduce bandwidth
                         Airport rings (for ATC) should be generated in front end
                Improve Performance
                         Searching through latest_json array      should not be necessary for drawing airport/airplane lines (on hover)
