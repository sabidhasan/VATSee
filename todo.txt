         *  Critical Features to Add:
              Units function in front end
              
              Centre polygon
              
              Add logging
                              log airports at 0,0 lat/lon. These should be entered into database
                              log all non-parsable lines from reading vatsim txt file
                              go through code and see possible logging (try except, if blocks, etc.)
              
              Why is everything in Liverpool NS?
              
              Styling - consult VATAWARE
              
              If no departure/arrival airport, then dont draw lines on hover!
              Deal with aircraft that have no departure/arrival (should have no departure/arrival ID and not draw a line upon hover)

              JavaScript should add autoupdate every minute
              
              Tab: Flight Planning
              Tab: Weather
              Tab: Events
              Tab: Preferences

          *  Non Critical relatively Easy:
               Logon time for ATC should be human readable

               Show arrivals and departures sorted by time - currently unsorted (simple fix I think)!

          *  Nice to Have Features (hard):
                ICAO/VATSIM/PE connection
                Make the backend into a Class, and call class methods in the "/Update" function, rahter than doing thigns there

                Add hover for info window - time online, frequency, controller name, METAR, airport diagram/procedures etc.
                ALSO correct typos in that hover window
                 
                DELAY
                        Also, show busiest airports (based on # of departuesx and arrivals)
                        if not in DB and 0 AGL, then INJECT them into DB
                        if ARE in DB and 0 AGL, do nothing
                        if > 0 AGL but <5000 ft and IN DB, then calculate delay (started at 0, but now taken off), DELETE from DB
                Reduce bandwidth
                         Plane heading roatation should be done in front end to reduce bandwidth
                         Airport rings (for ATC) should be generated in front end
                Improve Performance
                         Searching through latest_json array      should not be necessary for drawing airport/airplane lines (on hover)

          * Debugging
                Debug the shit out of route drawing - many things are broken right now (why points appear very far away)
                Which country airspace for hovered airplanes                TRIED AND FAILED
